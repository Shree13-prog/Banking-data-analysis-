# Banking-data-analysis-

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze key banking and insurance metrics using Tableau and deliver actionable insights through interactive visualizations. This dashboard helps identify:

- The most valuable insurance distribution channels
- Trends in premium collections over the years
- Shareholding distribution among investor categories
- Profitability across cities and policy tenures
- Stakeholder-wise asset management patterns
  
By visualizing this data, stakeholders can make better strategic decisions around investments, partnerships, and regional expansion.

## Tools used
- Microsoft Excel – for initial data cleaning and formatting
- SQL – for querying and preparing structured data
- Tableau Public – for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations

## Key questions
1. Which insurance channel creates the highest value?
2. How have premium collections changed over the years?
3. What is the current shareholding pattern?
4. Which cities show the highest profitability, and how does it vary with policy tenure?
5. Which stakeholder group holds the most assets under management?
6. What is the total premium collected and how does it relate to value creation?
7. What is the average age of stakeholders and how might that impact strategy?
8. What is the overall equity value and highest value achieved?

## Key analysis and insights
1. Top Value-Creating Channels
Bancassurance stands out as the most valuable insurance distribution channel, generating ₹139.91B. Partner branches come next at ₹60.98B, followed by brokers at ₹33.80B. Corporate agents, employees, and other channels contribute far less. This makes it clear that bancassurance should remain a strategic priority for maximizing value.

2. Premium Collection Trends
Single premium policies saw a peak in 2016 and 2017 with 732 policies, but declined sharply after that. Renewal premiums remained steady from 2017 to 2023, hovering around 365 policies per year. First-year premium policies peaked in 2021, then dropped. These patterns point to a shift from one-time premium models to renewal-based plans, showing customer stickiness and long-term policy retention.

3. Shareholding Distribution
Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) hold the largest stake at 38.39%, followed by Domestic Institutional Investors (30.15%) and Promoters (28.15%). Retail investors make up only 3.30%. This shows the market is mostly driven by large institutional players, with retail participation remaining quite limited.

4. Profitability by City & Tenure
Goa is the most profitable city, with 3,080 short-term and 2,045 long-term policies. Ahmedabad and Mumbai also perform well, particularly in the 1–3 year tenure category. Some cities like Jhalna and Jamshedpur have minimal policy counts, indicating possible areas for market expansion.

5. Assets Under Stakeholders
People (individual customers) dominate the AUM segment with 5,024 accounts. Other key stakeholders like Distributors, Investors, and Community members each contribute around 900 accounts. This reinforces the importance of focusing on individuals in asset management strategy.

6. Total Premium & Value Link
The total premium collected amounts to ₹245.9B, and the highest individual value created is ₹49.17M. This strong premium base complements the performance of top channels like Bancassurance, highlighting an effective revenue model.

7. Stakeholder Demographics
With an average stakeholder age of 34, the target audience is relatively young. This presents an opportunity to use digital platforms and personalized services to increase engagement and conversions.

8. Equity & Financial Strength
The equity value stands at ₹230.8B, reflecting the company’s strong financial health and its potential to support further growth or diversification.

## Recommendations
1. Focus on bancassurance partnerships to maximize value creation.
2. Launch customer retention campaigns to boost policy renewals.
3. Run financial literacy drives to increase retail investor participation.
4. Prioritize marketing in high-profit cities like Goa, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad.
5. Develop mobile-first platforms to engage the younger stakeholder base.
6. Offer personalized plans and support for individual customers.
7. Repackage single premium products to revive buyer interest.
8. Run awareness campaigns in low-performing cities to improve reach.
9. Highlight institutional investor trust to attract more retail customers.

## Conclusion 
This analysis provides a clear view of the company’s financial health and operational dynamics. Strong institutional trust, effective bancassurance partnerships, and robust performance in select cities signal promising strengths. However, rising operational costs, underperformance in major markets like Mumbai, and anomalies in product lines need urgent attention. By strategically addressing these areas, the company can unlock new growth opportunities. A data-driven approach will be key to sustaining long-term success and stakeholder value.
